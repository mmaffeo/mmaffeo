- limit use of BSP macro

-DONE *************************************************************************

x- verfiy matlab's "portable" data types
  x- add CTAs

x- Flash wait states
  x- Need 6 wait states for 168MHz @ 2.4V (Datasheet Table 15)
  x- default may not work with low voltage
  x- measure cpu usage difference
  x- Timing
    x- 5 wait states
      x- max run time: 367us / 1000us
      x- avg run time: ~27us / 1000us
      x- ~18ms checksum
    x- 6 wait states (~3.5% more time to execute same amount of code)
      x- max run time: 380us / 1000us
      x- avg run time: ~28us / 1000us
      x- ~18ms checksum (did not seem to change)

x- Optimization breaks sleep function
x- move eeServiceEEPROM() into scheduler

x- Watchdog kicked from outside scheduler
  x- Need to protect all tasks


- Bootblock
  x- option bytes
    x- cleanup code
    x- Set to 0x0FFCAAC4
    x- flash protection
    x- Enable Watchdog at startup
    x- Voltage Monitor POR / PDR / BOR
      x- Al to determine range
        x- lets go with BOR2 on the brownout reset (2.44 V minimum)
  x- driver reinits
  x- jump to app method
  x- can terminators
  x- power hold
  x- bb reflash
  x- Startup Timing
    x- HCS12 takes ~300ms to start app
    x- M4 BB
      x- ~80ms without NVM
      x- ~200ms with NVM
    x- M4 App
      x- App running at ~20ms (220ms from power on)
      x- NVM restored at ~190ms (390ms from power on)

x- fix fin driver
  x- send new driver to phil

x-fix interrupt disable
  x-interrupt disable is called too many times

x-verify can term state in bootloader
x-fix gateway flash loader

x-fix bspTest

x- Unused pin, default states

x- call combine from post build scripts

x- Watchdog
  x- ~100ms (1000ms on HCS12)
  x- change to (300 to 600ms)

x- The eeprom test should respond with a 1 in tstate if the test is a success... today it just remains 0.

x- Update MEX gtw to latest BSP
  x- Sleeps after ap_init breaks scheduler stats
    x- move io init to bsp init funcs



x- Move bsp.c and h to ap
x- split bsp_rom

x- Enable NVM in BB
  -  9410 bytes ROM disabled
  - 12251 bytes ROM enabled


-HCS12 emulation
  x- io
  x- mcu
  x- ecuid
  x- can
  x- clock
  x- dio
  x- pwm
  x- adc
  x- fin
  x- reset
  x- eeprom
    x- nvm
    x- hwt
      x- Added nvm test to bsp_nvm driver
        x- same as old nvm test
      x- Connect bsp test to hwt
    x- resize sections for memory aligned projects
    x- Still failing checksum (these should be OK)
      x- EE_MIRROR_RESTORE_PASSWORDS( i == 0 only)
      x- EE_MIRROR_RESTORE_SERVICE_CLOCK_QUEUE
      x- EE_MIRROR_RESTORE_USER_LOG
      x- EE_MIRROR_RESTORE_SOFTWARE_UPDATE

-direct reads
  x-nvm
  x-flash
  x-ram

x- IAR optimizations
  x- using too much flash

x- cdata pointers

- BSP enumerations
  - hcs12 mapping

- schedule code review
  - one at a time

- ap_mode

- Move HCS12 to libs

- Fix bservie programming settings
  - add to sdata

- fix bservice direct memory access

- fix bservice endianess issues
